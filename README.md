# SaleRecords
Sale Records: Big O Notation Project
Imagine you work for a retail company that needs to process sales records. Each record contains:

A unique sale ID.
A sale date.
The amount of the sale.
The product name sold.
Your program will offer the options to:

Load in sales data (reading from a CSV or database).
Retrieve the latest sale
Compute the total revenue
Check for duplicate sale IDs 
Search for a sale by its ID
You will measure the performance of these operations and compare them against their theoretical Big O time complexity. 
Generate python code to randomly generate n number of data to store in a CSV for testing purposes. You will measure the time
each operation takes at dataset sizes of 100, 1.000, 10.000, and 100.000 (if possible) and graph your results.
